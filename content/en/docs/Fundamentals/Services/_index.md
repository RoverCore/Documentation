## What is a service?

A service is a, often loosely coupled, reusable software component which may be distributed and accessed through a program. Software services essentially serve as a base or template for a specific task that is given to others to manipulate as they please.

Software companies will often use a “Software as a service” model, which essentially means that they develop customisable software that is either given or sold off to clients. A great example of this would be Rovercore itself, which is a software service that provides a baseplate to develop other software services.

## Why use it?

Services have many different purposes depending on what they were designed to do. Essentially they serve as a tool kit for others to make exactly what they need. They allow the client to bypass the difficult part of what they are doing or making and allow them to focus on creating what actually matters.

## How do I use it?

Again, this largely depends on the service in question. Certain software services are available for free and allow developers to download and start manipulating it the way they please. Other services may run on a subscription basis or may be distributed as a commission. In those cases, the client would have to pay before being able to use the service in question.
